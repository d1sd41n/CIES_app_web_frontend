<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

In order to use this project you must have node.js installed on your operating system and you must have the backend working


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/d1sd41n/CIES_app_web_frontend.git
   ```
2- Enter the project directory and install the node packages
  ```sh
   npm i
   ```
3- set the backend url, In the module:
```sh
src/variables/backendURL.js
```
you will find the variable of type string "backendUrl", modify it and place the url towards your backend
```js
const backendUrl = "http://My_backend_URL.example";


export default backendUrl;
```

it is important not to write a slash in the last character of the url

##### backendUrl = "http://My_backend_URL.example/" WRONG!!!!!!!!!! >:(

##### backendUrl = "http://My_backend_URL.example" GOOD!!!!  :D

4- Run the project

```sh
npm start
```
